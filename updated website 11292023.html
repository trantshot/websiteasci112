        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            A toucan is a distinctive and colorful bird that belongs to the family Ramphastidae, primarily found in the tropical forests of Central and South America, and they are known for their distinctive, brightly colored bills. When it comes to their nutritional group and digestive tract design, toucans are considered frugivores. This means that their primary diet consists of fruits, although they may occasionally consume insects, small vertebrates, and even eggs.
        </p>
        <h3>Feeding Behaviors</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large-5/toco-toucan-eating-fruit-science-photo-library.jpg" alt="Toucan">
            The primary component of a toucan's diet is fruits. They scavenge for and feed on a wide variety of fruits, and their bill is adapted to pluck fruits from branches or even snatch them in mid-air. Toucans are known for their agility in capturing fruits, and they can eat a wide range of fruit sizes. They have a unique habit of regurgitating indigestible seeds, pits, and other unwanted materials after eating. This regurgitated matter, often in the form of pellets, helps them remove the parts of the fruit that are difficult to digest. While fruits are their primary food source, toucans are opportunistic and may supplement their diet with insects, small vertebrates, and even the eggs of other birds when fruits are scarce. Their bill's dexterity also comes in handy when capturing insects or small prey.Toucans are social birds and are often seen feeding in groups. They communicate with each other through various vocalizations while foraging for food. Group feeding allows them to benefit from safety in numbers and share information about food sources.        </p>

        <h3>Nutritional Ecology Classification</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://keelbilledtoucan.weebly.com/uploads/5/2/0/3/52035073/4049257.jpg?1431805809" alt="Toucan">
            Toucans play a critical role in the ecosystems where they live by acting as seed dispersers. When they eat fruits, they often ingest seeds along with the flesh. These seeds are later excreted in different locations, promoting the spread and germination of plant species. This ecological service enhances the biodiversity and health of their forest habitats.Toucans require a diet rich in sugars, vitamins, and other nutrients found in fruits. Fruits provide them with essential carbohydrates for energy, as well as a variety of vitamins and minerals crucial for their health.

        <h3>Digestive Anatomy & Anatomical Classification</h3>
        <p>
            Special traits associated with these birds would be the crop, proventriculus and gizzard, where the food is broken down ( because they are unable to chew). 
Hormones that help regulate digestion and nutrient utilization in Toucans: 
Gastrin: Gastrin is produced by cells in the stomach lining and stimulates the secretion of gastric acid, which aids in the breakdown of food.
Secretin: Secretin is released from the small intestine in response to the presence of acidic chyme (partially digested food) in the duodenum. It stimulates the pancreas to release bicarbonate, which helps neutralize the acidity of the chyme.
Cholecystokinin (CCK): CCK is produced in the small intestine and is released in response to the presence of fats and proteins. It stimulates the release of bile from the gallbladder and pancreatic enzymes, facilitating the digestion and absorption of fats and proteins.
Ghrelin: Ghrelin is known as the "hunger hormone" and is produced in the stomach. It stimulates appetite and promotes the intake of food.
Insulin: Insulin, produced by the pancreas, plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism. It facilitates the uptake of glucose by cells, promoting energy storage and regulating blood sugar levels.
Glucagon: Also produced by the pancreas, glucagon has the opposite effect of insulin. It stimulates the release of stored glucose into the bloodstream when blood sugar levels are low.

        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The electric eel, scientifically known as Electrophorus electricus, is a fascinating species of fish native to the Amazon and Orinoco basins of South America. Despite its name, the electric eel is not actually an eel, but a type of knifefish. This remarkable creature is distinguished by its unique ability to generate electric shocks, which it uses for navigation, communication, and prey. An electric eel can generate as much as 650 volts from there shocks. While yes, this can be deadly to some animals, it is mainly used as a scaring tactic to steer off most predators (Valasco). Electric eels live in slow or stagnant waters, such as rivers, swamps, and flooded forests, where they can hide among aquatic vegetation and submerged logs. They are solitary creatures and their social structure revolves mainly around mating and territorial disputes.        </p>

        <h3>Feeding Behaviors</h3>
        <p>
            Electric eels feed mainly on fish, amphibians and invertebrates.Specialized cells called electrocytes make up the majority of its long, cylindrical body. When the electric eel detects prey or perceives a threat, it rapidly discharges a series of electrical pulses. These pulses can reach voltages of several hundred volts and are produced by the synchronized activity of thousands of electrocytes. The electric field generated by the shocks can immobilize or stun nearby prey, making them easier for the electric eel to capture and consume. Additionally, electric eels are known to use lower-voltage discharges for navigation and communication in their murky underwater environments (Carlson).        </p>

        <h3>Nutritional Ecology Classification</h3>
        <p>
            The nutritional ecological classification of electric eels places them in the category of carnivorous continuous feeders. They are carnivores because their diet consists mainly of animal matter such as fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. They are continuous feeders because they actively hunt and eat prey regularly without skipping feeding periods.(Animal-World) 
        </p>

        <h3>Digestive Anatomy & Anatomical Classification</h3>
        <p>
            The electric eel has a relatively simple gastrointestinal anatomy characterized by a monogastric structure. They have a one-chambered stomach to process food. Because they primarily eat small prey  that can be swallowed whole, they lack specialized teeth or the need to chew. Electric eels are not foregut or hindgut digesters; instead, their digestive system is designed to directly enzymatically break down ingested animal matter in the stomach.

    <!-- Fossa Section -->
    <div class="section" id="fossa">
        <h2>Fossa</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hv9VOY2H61Y?si=7D6Ub_OQpIN3MA6I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The Fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox) is the largest wild carnivore living in Madagascar with a geographical range extending over the whole island. It generally lives in small numbers in all remaining forests on the island, preferring pristine and safe forests. With 70-80 cm of length and 5.5-8.6 kg of weight, it has a short reddish-brown smooth and relatively dense fur, and a tail almost as long as its body. Adult males are larger than females. Individuals in the North and the East of Madagascar are generally smaller than those in the South and the West. Although the Fosa is ubiquitous within the Madagascar forest areas, it has a very low density and is very difficult to see. "The total population within the current protected areas is estimated at less than 2500 adults. The Masoala National Park in the MaMaBay landscape is one of the two only protected areas containing more than 500 adults." It has been reported that the population size of the Fosa has continuously declined by approximately 30% over the last 21 years.

            The Fosa is active both day and night. It is terrestrial but its semi-retractile claws allow him to climb and jump from tree to tree as lemur does. Its diet consists mainly of lemurs, tenrecs, and rodents. Its other known preys include lizards, birds, and poultry. "As in all other localities in Madagascar, the Fosa suffers from habitat destruction and hunting in the MaMaBay Landscape. Studies made in the villages around the Makira Natural Park since 2005 showed that 57% of the local population hunts Fosa for consumption. Preying on poultry, the Fosa is locally perceived as pest and is hunted by villagers. Strict conservation measures are needed as its local or total extinction could greatly impact on ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to an overpopulation of some of its preys." Since 2008, a comprehensive research program through a camera-trapping technique has been conducted in the MaMaBay Landscape to acquire relevant eco-biological and geographical information to ensure their management and monitor their relationship with the lemur populations within this landscape. Local people are trained on the techniques of improved poultry farming to help them abandon excessive bushmeat hunting. "Information and awareness campaigns directed on the importance of Fosa are also made to involve local people in the conservation of this species."

        <h3>Feeding Behaviors</h3>
        <p>

            As Madagascar's apex predator, the fossa's diet primarily consists of lemurs, showcasing its top-tier status in the food chain. Its hunting methods are a marvel of evolutionary adaptation. The fossa utilizes its exceptional agility to navigate the forest canopy in pursuit of prey and employs a blend of stealth and speed on the ground for ambushing targets. This style of hunting categorizes the fossa as a discontinuous feeder, with periods of plentiful hunting followed by times of scarcity. Understanding the fossa's feeding behavior is crucial in comprehending its role in the ecosystem. Its diet not only reflects its predatory skills but also highlights its importance in maintaining the ecological balance through population control of its prey.

        </p>

        <h3>Nutritional Ecology Classification</h3>
        <p>
            In the realm of nutritional ecology, the fossa's classification as an obligate carnivore is evident through its reliance on the consumption of other animals to fulfill its dietary needs. This aligns it with other solitary hunters known for their predatory prowess. The fossa exhibits a monogastric digestive system, optimized for meat digestion, which includes robust and sharp teeth for delivering lethal bites and carnassial molars adept at shearing flesh. Its physical adaptations, such as semi-retractable claws and ankles capable of rotating 180 degrees, enhance its arboreal agility. These characteristics not only facilitate effective hunting in diverse habitats but also underscore the fossa's ecological role in Madagascar. The interconnection of its physical and physiological adaptations with its habitat and diet is a classic example of evolutionary specialization.

        </p>

        <h3>Digestive Anatomy & Anatomical Classification</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/kantdigestioinmonogastricnotdelete-150422135933-conversion-gate01/85/digestion-in-monogastric-animal-and-hormonal-control-1-320.jpg?cb=1666160851" alt="Fossa">
            Comparing the nutritional ecologies of various species reveals both similarities and differences. One common aspect is the adaptation to habitat: like the fossa, other species have evolved specific traits to thrive in their environments. Another similarity is the specialized diets reflecting their position in the food chain. In contrast, the types of food consumed vary significantly, with the fossa's carnivorous diet contrasting with herbivorous or omnivorous diets of other species. Additionally, the digestive tract anatomy differs widely, with the fossa’s monogastric system being distinct from other digestive systems like those of ruminants or hindgut fermenters. These similarities and differences are shaped by environmental factors, survival strategies, and evolutionary history. Understanding these aspects helps in comprehending the intricate balance of ecosystems and the role each species plays in maintaining ecological health.

    <!-- Golden Retriever Section -->
    <div class="section" id="golden-retriever">
        <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
        <img src="https://www.vidavetcare.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/234/2022/04/golden-retriever-dog-breed-info.jpeg" alt="Golden Retriever">
        
        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The Golden Retriever, scientifically known as the Canis Lupus Familiaris, is one of the most popular dog breeds in the world. Their advanced problem solving skills, as well as advanced working capabilities make them great service and therapeutic animals. This dog breed originates out of Scotland, and on average weighs about 55-75 pounds. Goldens are well known for their lucious, soft golden fur. The retriever aspect of the name comes from the dog's desire to retrieve objects. Hip and elbow dysplasia, cancer, and underlying heart conditions are very common within this breed, so it is important that they be fed a good, clean diet, and exercise often. This species is a domesticated species which humans have chosen to raise as pets in their own homes. These animals are known to be extremely intelligent, and are able to understand their owners very well. They are super friendly and easy to train, making them a huge hit for young families        </p>
    
        <h3>Feeding Behaviors</h3>
        <p>
            This animal's diet depends on what its owners choose to feed it. Most Goldens typically are fed a strictly dry kibble diet, but high protein as well, because this breed requires lots of protein to support their muscle mass and energy needs. But, some owners also choose to feed their dogs raw diets, which has been scientifically proven to put these animals at greater risk of disease, because they have evolved to consume a normal, dry diet. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>Nutritional Ecology Classification</h3>
        <p>
            Goldens are categorized as discontinuous feeders. They do not tend to graze and look for food, but rather they have a set time during the day which they are fed by their owners. They do not have a continuous need for food, as they are only fed 1-2 times daily. They are also considered omnivores, as they eat a wide variety of different foods, ranging from plants to animals. Why they are considered omnivores links back to years and years of domestication. Goldens are typically classified as hunters, as they have strong hunting instincts, and bring home animals such as birds and rats to their homes to show off. They could also be considered scavengers, as they tend to clean up a lot of food left around the house by their humans. These categories can all be linked because they hunt animals and can also consume animals, and often tend to scavenge around when let outside as well, linking back to their wolf age of before they were domesticated. 
        </p>
    
        <h3>Digestive Anatomy & Anatomical Classification</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-yjB_bittWBjicoFKJR6GT-P5pDA0w8WHmf7BbDP-W-iTczaqbC0mdFIKvhsbf1DVZ_xYOeEfBTU0psw4LVycsFOCYqiAyxKa8lKRhH-tB80E1IhB9tL--bniQbTRHSMgs0k2PZluH-qqkAJ9JVLSoQ" alt="Golden Retriever">
            Similar to humans, dogs are monogastric, meaning they have a single chambered stomach. This single chambered stomach helps Goldens to further digest a wide variety of food types. Further classified, Golden Retrievers are known to be colonic digesters, meaning they have a short simple cecum, and a sacculated colon.

        <h3>General Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            The mantis shrimp is a fascinating marine crustacean found in tropical and subtropical waters, notorious for its vibrant colors and extraordinary vision. Boasting over 450 species, they exhibit unique behaviors and have become known for their strong, raptorial claws. Mantis shrimp possess 16 types of photoreceptors, enabling them to see polarized light and ultraviolet light, providing them with one of the most complex visual systems known. They use their remarkable eyesight for various activities, including communication, mating rituals, and hunting.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Feeding Behaviors</h3>
        <p>
            Active predators, mantis shrimp can be categorized into two main types based on their hunting methods: 'spearers,' who are equipped with spiny appendages to impale soft-bodied prey like fish and worms, and 'smashers,' who possess club-like appendages capable of delivering a powerful blow to crack open the hard exoskeletons of snails and crustaceans. Their diverse hunting techniques denote a complex approach to feeding and an adaptation to varied prey in their environment.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Nutritional Ecology Classification</h3>
        <p>
            As discontinuous carnivores, mantis shrimp are selective hunters that rely on their acute vision and rapid strike ability. They consume a diet mainly of live prey, reflecting their predatory nature and the need for a rich source of protein to sustain their powerful and high-energy hunting tactics. While previously thought to have a narrow diet built around what type of claw it has (soft for spearers and hard shelled for smashers), recent research has shown that shrimp with smasher claws actually have a more broad diet than that of spearers due to having more types of prey it can hunt.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Digestive Anatomy & Anatomical Classification</h3>
        <p>
            <img src="        http://mantisshrimpresource.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/4/7/26473379/669032671.gif" alt="Mantis Shrimp">
            The digestive system of the mantis shrimp is adapted to their carnivorous diet, featuring a monogastric stomach to process their food. Unlike ruminants with complex stomachs, the mantis shrimp's simpler digestive tract reflects their diet of primarily meat, which is easier to digest than plant material. This simplicity is exemplified by a non-sacculated colonic digester, indicative of a straightforward digestive process.

        <h2>Fun Fact Page of the Day!</h2>
        <p>
            Between the 5 species listed within our website, there are obviously many differences associated with the different species. One big difference is the ways that these animals feed throughout the day. While some species like to feed only a few times a day, similarly to humans, others species are constantly grazing and hunting for food. The Toucan and Electric Eel are two breeds which are considered continuous feeders. They both continuously hunt and scavenge for food throughout the day. While on the other hand, the Golden Retriever, Fossa, and Mantis Shrimp are all discontinuous feeders, which means they only feed a few times a day. The Golden Retriever would most likely be a continuous feeder if they had the ability, but their owners control how much they consume. While the Fossa and Mantis hunt for their food, and decide how much of an animal they would like to consume in a single sitting. A big difference between the electric eel and the golden retriever is that an electric eel is a continuous feeder where as the golden retriever is a discontinous feeder. This means that the golden retriever can go long periods of time without hunting for food, where as the eel feeds continuously throughout the day. 
            Another difference is between the toucan and the eel. A toucan is largely reliant on sugars, vitamins and minerals provided by fruit which means they do not hunt other animals to feed on. Where as an eel, does completely the opposite. An eel will continuously throughout the day hunt on smaller fish in order to feed itself. 
            One of the main differences between our five species is the method in which they obtain their food. Each one has specific tools and techniques at their disposal that are geared towards obtaining meals. The toucan’s diet consists of smaller foods such as fruits and small insects, and uses its beak to assist in grasping and plucking them. The electric eel uses electricity to hunt down and stun its prey, allowing it to easily catch and consume small fish and invertebrates. The mantis shrimp also hunts down smaller aquatic creatures, but it instead utilizes its strong appendages to smash or stab prey. Lastly, while the fossa and golden retriever are pretty similar in terms of being carnivorous mammals, their method of obtaining food differs. Fossas primarily hunt lemurs, so they run through the rainforest’s ground and canopy to stealthily hunt down and ambush its target with its teeth and claws. The golden retriever typically receives food from humans, due to thousands of years of domestication making them adorable and perfect for human care. The golden retriever also hunts, but is more of a scavenger than the fossa and isn’t as agile.
            Even though they might seem different, there are some similarties. The electric eel, the fossa, and the mantis shrimp are all carnivores in the sense that they all consume other animals for the majority of their diet. Their diet consists mainly of animal tissues, such as muscles, organs, and bones. (can add 
            in nutrition ecology classification after the word invertebrates. Toucans live in tropical areas which is similar to that  of the Mantis Shrimp. While one is on water and the other is on land, they both inhabit the same geographical regions.
